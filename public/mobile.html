                        This JIRA mockup is build with HTML, Sass, and Vanilla Javascript, mostly in its ES6 version.
                        Compilers technologies are integrated in the repository, so the "parsing" from
                        ES6 and Sass, to ES5 and to CSS it is possible thanks to Babel and Sass.
                    </p>
                    <p class="reg-par">
                        It's important to notice that besides compilers such as Babel and Sass, it's utilizing toosl such Eslint
                        and Pretty. We are not utilizing a server, so our client server is thanks to "live-server".
